### Slide 3: Background Services Overview
**Description:**
- Background services are long-running processes in .NET applications that do not require user interaction.
- Useful for tasks like background processing, periodic tasks, and event-driven processing.

---

### Slide 4: Worker
**Description:**
- Worker service template in .NET Core is designed for long-running background tasks.
- Provides a simple way to create background services that can be hosted in various environments like Windows Services or Linux Daemons.

**When to Use:**
- Suitable for lightweight background tasks that need to run continuously or at regular intervals.

**Demo:**
- Title: Worker Service Demo
- Description: Create a worker service that logs a message every minute.

---

### Slide 5: IHostedService
**Description:**
- Interface for implementing a hosted service.
- Provides methods for starting and stopping background tasks.

**When to Use:**
- Ideal for services that need full control over their lifecycle.

**Demo:**
- Title: IHostedService Demo
- Description: Implement IHostedService to create a background task that runs on application startup and stops gracefully on shutdown.

---

### Slide 6: BackgroundService
**Description:**
- Base class for implementing long-running background services.
- Provides a convenient way to handle the background execution logic.

**When to Use:**
- Use when you need a straightforward implementation of background tasks with automatic lifecycle management.

**Demo:**
- Title: BackgroundService Demo
- Description: Derive from BackgroundService to create a task that performs periodic health checks.

---

### Slide 7: Hangfire Overview
**Description:**
- An open-source library for scheduling and executing background jobs in .NET applications.
- Supports various job types like Fire-and-Forget, Delayed, Recurring, and Continuations.

---

### Slide 8: Fire and Forget Jobs
**Description:**
- Executes a job once, immediately after it's been created.

**When to Use:**
- Suitable for tasks that need to be processed once and do not need to be awaited.

**Demo:**
- Title: Fire and Forget Jobs Demo
- Description: Schedule a Fire-and-Forget job to send an email notification.

---

### Slide 9: Recurring Jobs
**Description:**
- Schedules jobs to run at specified intervals.

**When to Use:**
- Ideal for tasks that need to run on a regular schedule, such as cleaning up temporary files or generating reports.

**Demo:**
- Title: Recurring Jobs Demo
- Description: Create a recurring job that generates a daily report.

---

### Slide 10: Continuations
**Description:**
- Jobs that are executed after the completion of a parent job.

**When to Use:**
- Useful for workflows where a task needs to be performed sequentially after another task completes.

**Demo:**
- Title: Continuations Demo
- Description: Implement a continuation job that processes data after it's uploaded.

---

### Slide 11: Batches (PRO License Required)
**Description:**
- Groups multiple background jobs into a single batch.
- Provides atomic operations for job execution, allowing all jobs in the batch to succeed or fail as a unit.

**When to Use:**
- Suitable for complex workflows requiring multiple steps to be executed together.

**Demo:**
- Title: Batches Demo
- Description: Create a batch job that performs a series of operations like data import, processing, and export.

---

### Slide 12: Durable Task Framework Overview
**Description:**
- A framework for writing durable, reliable, and scalable task orchestrations.
- Supports various backends like Azure Storage and SQL Server.

---

### Slide 13: DurableTask.AzureStorage
**Description:**
- Uses Azure Storage for persistence.
- Scales automatically with Azure infrastructure.

**When to Use:**
- Ideal for cloud-based applications requiring high scalability and reliability.

**Demo:**
- Title: DurableTask.AzureStorage Demo
- Description: Implement a durable task that orchestrates a multi-step workflow using Azure Storage backend.

---

### Slide 14: DurableTask.SqlServer
**Description:**
- Uses SQL Server for persistence.
- Suitable for on-premises or hybrid cloud scenarios.

**When to Use:**
- Suitable for applications with existing SQL Server infrastructure or those requiring on-premises solutions.

**Demo:**
- Title: DurableTask.SqlServer Demo
- Description: Create a durable task that coordinates a series of database operations using SQL Server backend.

---

### Slide 15: Scheduling with Kube Jobs Overview
**Description:**
- Kubernetes Jobs are used to run a finite task to completion.
- Can be scheduled to run background tasks in a Kubernetes cluster.

---

### Slide 16: Scheduling with Kube Jobs
**Description:**
- Demonstrates how to schedule jobs in a Kubernetes environment.
- Can integrate with .NET background services for more complex workflows.

**Demo:**
- Title: Kube Jobs Scheduling Demo
- Description: Show how to create and schedule a Kubernetes job that executes a .NET background service.

---

### Slide 17: Q&A
**Description:**
- Open the floor for questions and discussions.
- Encourage participants to ask about specific scenarios or challenges they face.

---

### Slide 18: Thank You
**Description:**
- Thank the audience for their time and participation.
- Provide contact information for further questions or follow-ups.
